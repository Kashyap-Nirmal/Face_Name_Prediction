# Comparison table

- Result table of classification accuracy (\%). The models with higher accuracies than the baseline are represented in \textbf{bold}. The accuracies are rounded off to 2 decimal places.

- In the table \ref{tab1} prefix SPP stands for Spatial pyramid pooling. These algorithms have used SPP for feature extraction. While the suffix DL stands for Deep learning feature.

- Name100 subset 1 stands for classes Chris, Jamie, Maggie, Stephen, and Tina. So the distribution of this subset includes 2 male names, 2 female names and 1 gender-neutral name. Name100 subset 2 stands for classes Abby, Amanda, Angela, Aaron, and Andrea. So the distribution of this subset includes 1 male name, 4 female names.
